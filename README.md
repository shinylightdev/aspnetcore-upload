# Upload with Progress Bar

Sample project that shows you how to upload a file using a progress bar in ASP.NET Core in .NET 5. It uses JavaScript to trigger the upload.

Most of the code is in \Views\Home\Index.cshtml and \Controllers\HomeController.cs. The rest is just part of the Visual Studio started template.
